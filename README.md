        <h2>Senior in highschool in Greenville, South Carolina</h2> 
         
         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones Academy. I am planning on going to Bob Jones University and I'm planning on taking a dual major with business and ministry. </p> 
         <p> 
            I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my 
local church: Morningside Baptist Church.  I lead music in youth group. &amp; I like to help out in our church in lots of activities. The Senior Saints Banquet is a great opportunity to serve and to help fund our mission trips during the summer.  
            I love video games, hiking, and my favorite author is Brandon Sanderson.
